When we render our cards =>
   we also render the "add to watchlist" button
   *Give it a data-attribute: data-id: # or imdbID

document.addEventListener so when anything clicks on the screen
   check if it has a dataset of data-id:
      IF if does EITHER:
         ADD {
            title: id (has to be unique imdbID bcz we need to see if it's in there already too)
            body: Object (where do we get this?)
         }

         REMOVE

So that when we render our watchlist...
   we can just use the object we get back
   INSTEAD of fetching for the data again AND creating a new instance of that data

^ NOPE DOESNT WORK, button has not been rendered yet


WHAT DO WE NEED TO POST=> {id, object}
we are 
1. getting ALL the Search
2. createing all the Object
   2.1 give each button an imdbID
3. RENDING all the OBJECTS

4. listening for the object's HTML buttons
   4.1 CLICKED we have button=imdbID
      this tells us which movie
      - we could fetch again or
      - look for the object (how?)
         - Solution: keep a global array of object
         - ELSE: we need to change our code structure where instead of fetching all the objects, then instantianing all the objects, then rending all the objects at once.
            we would have to fetch, instantiate, render, give eventListener ONE by ONE (WHICH DOESNT SEEM LIKE A GOOD IDEA, lot of nesting)
