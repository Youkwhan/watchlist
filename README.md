## Demo link
Access my site at [https://watchlist-bookmark.netlify.app/](https://watchlist-bookmark.netlify.app/)

## Overview
Movie Watchlist is a website that allows users to keep track and add movies, TV shows, and more to their own personalized watchlist and remove them when as you finish. It uses the Open Movie Database (OMDb) API to fetch movie data by title, name, and id.

### Features:
The challenge consisted of:
- Making API calls to the OMBd API to get movie data by the search value.
- Rendering to the DOM the searched movies.
- Give the user the ability to store movies to the watchlist using localStorage.
- Fetching the stored movies from localStorage and render them to the DOM.
- Give the user the ability to remove movies from the watchlist.

### Built with:
- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript
- Figma
- REST API

- I have pushed the API Key as well though it has a 1000 requests per day limit since it's a free key. You can get your own free key at : https://www.omdbapi.com/ and change it with mine :)
